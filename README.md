# New Undergrounds Bot
The whole code of the New Undergrounds Bot, my most recent project

This bot was made for an SCP: Secret Laboratory server, made by Lyxy

I accept any reviews in the code about **optimization**, im not going to say im new on this, but im pretty bad at it lol

You can find the bot in this server: [New Undergrounds SCP](https://discord.gg/wYsduG5xde)

# Other
All the Commands:
- 8ball
- avatar
- blacklist `(This blacklist system was made for a server in the game SCP:SL, so it doesn't affect anything about the bot)`
- warn
- event `(This was also made for the SCP:SL server)`
- claim 
- set-claim `(This command makes codes with a prize you can specify)`
- faq
- logro
- react
- say
- timeout

This bot uses the npm [MegaDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/megadb) as its main database manager, if you want to use another Database Manager, youll need to adapt the code to it.
